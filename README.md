# Introduction

As students arrive at university, it is apparent that there is a disparity between the knowledge of basic life skills across different populations. These skills will not be taught during their university courses, however, they are still important for students to learn. Many people learn these skills from those around them, such as parents or older siblings, and yet part of the novelty of this new environment is that they are now away from this familiar support system and have to learn by themselves for the first time. Additionally, according to a Forbes article, people spend an average of 1,300 hours on social media every year. These hours are often spent mindlessly scrolling, being unproductive and ultimately, deteriorating their mental health.

Growth Hub aims to bridge this gap by delivering content centered around learning life skills in a low-commitment, highly engaging lesson format. We are providing our users with engaging content in a lesson format targeted towards our users' individual learning styles while preserving the social aspect users crave on social apps. 

Our algorithm will recommend courses based on users’ topic preferences and, unlike existing platforms, we will feature personalized learning plans, expert content, and engaging competition through friend-based challenges.
